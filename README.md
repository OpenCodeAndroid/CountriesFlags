Fun with Flags

This app uses inspirations from Clean Code but it has no intention to be a guideline to Clean Code

Interesting points about the code:
Use Cases (mainly using coroutines to merge or map some of the data)
Repositories (at the moment uses coroutines in most of the implementation is possible to imagine more use of Flows )
Adapters (Dao Dto Model)
One Data by "Domain/Layer"
Inversion of Control making View Models very simple
Koin as DI
Notes: possible use of Flows in the future in areas like repositories and Room and Retrofit could make the code more efficient and elegant
